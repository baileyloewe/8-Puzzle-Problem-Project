#     8 Puzzle Problem Project

This project was part of my Aglorithms course where we had implement and benchmark search algorithms (DFS, UCS, BFS, and A Star) for the 8 puzzle problem

The 8 puzzle problem is presented as a 3x3 grid of numbers, 1-8, with a blank tile. The placement of the 9 tiles is randomized on the grid. The goal is to rearrange the tiles to a specific final state (a spiral from 1-8, with the blank tile in the center).

Overall, this one wasn't too difficult, though it initially presented a greater challenge than expected as implementation wasn't perfectly smooth with A Star; I was missing a key piece of the algorithm for a bit and wasn't getting the expected results, but I pieced together that I had omitted a fairly critical piece of the algorithm shortly after.
